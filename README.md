Wizard-of-Oz Content Manager
============================

This project contains a simple HTML- and JavaScript-based web page, designed to display a table of contents where each cell can be clicked to copy its content to the clipboard of your operating system. The content of the cells can be updated dynamically via input fields that are shown on the left side of the page.


Usage
-----
To run the web page, simply open it with your favorite browser.

Instructions on how to populate the table and how to implement the input fields can be found in the comments within the `woz-content-manager.html` file.
